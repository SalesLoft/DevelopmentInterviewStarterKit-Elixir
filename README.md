# SalesLoft Development Interview Starter Kit (Elixir)

This application is a jumping off point for the SalesLoft Development Interview,
its designed to cut out boilerplate so you can get straight to coding.

**For full-stack submissions**: Please build both an Elixir back-end and a React front-end. Think carefully about the responsibilities of each component.

Included in this app:

- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) `.tool-versions` file for recent Elixir/OTP versions
- Phoenix Web Layer
- Webpack Front-end build system
- React
- Redux
- Ecto (no tables defined)

# Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Have postgres available on standard local port
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
